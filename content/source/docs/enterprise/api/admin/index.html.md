# Private Terraform Enterprise Admin API Documentation

-> **Note**: These API endpoints are in beta and are subject to change.

-> These API endpoints are available in Private Terraform Enterprise as of version 201807-1.

Private Terraform Enterprise provides an API to allow administrators to configure and support their installation.

See the navigation sidebar for the list of available endpoints.

## Authentication

With the exception of the user impersonation endpoints, all requests must be authenticated with a bearer token belonging to a site administrator. Use the HTTP Header `Authorization` with the value `Bearer <token>`. This token can be generated or revoked on the account tokens page. In the context of the Admin API, your token has access to all resources in the system.
